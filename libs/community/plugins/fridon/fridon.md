## Problems FridonAI Solves

- **Advanced Cryptocurrency Analytics**: Analyzing cryptocurrency price charts often requires specialized knowledge and tools. FridonAI simplifies this process with intuitive features like Coin Price Analytics and TextToDiagram, allowing users to analyze and visualize coin performance using natural language commands.

- **Intelligent Coin Search**: Finding coins based on specific technical indicators or chart patterns has been cumbersome. With FridonSearch's Technical Coin Searcher, users can find coins through detailed textual descriptions. The Coin Chart Similarity Search discovers coins with similar historical or current chart patterns using pre-trained time series models.

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Missing trading opportunities due to lack of real-time notifications is a common issue. FridonNotifier enables users to set up custom notifications for specific indicators and scenarios, ensuring they stay informed of important market changes.

- **Simplified Blockchain Operations**: Executing blockchain operations often requires technical expertise, posing a barrier to many users. FridonBlockchain simplifies blockchain interactions through natural language commands, enabling users to perform operations like swapping tokens or checking balances effortlessly.

- **Community Contribution**: Addresses the limited community contribution in crypto tools. By open-sourcing the chat pipeline and providing the FridonAI-Core and FridonAI-Community packages, FridonAI encourages community contributions and makes it easier for developers to create and integrate new plugins and functionalities.

- **Educational Assistance in DeFi**: Helps users overcome barriers to learning and utilizing DeFi protocols. Through educational and practical assistance in FridonBlockchain and FridonChat, users are guided through DeFi operations like staking and swapping via simple text commands.
